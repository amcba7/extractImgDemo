          <h2>What is extract.pics?</h2>
          <p>
            Extract.pics is an easy to use tool that allows you to extract, view
            and download images from any public website. Simply paste the URL of
            the website into the input field and click "Extract" to start the
            process. After a few seconds you will see most or even all of the
            images found on the website
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>How can I find specific images?</h2>
          <p>
            You can view the found images in a grid or list and explore them by
            sorting them by name, type, dimensions, width, height or the actual
            file size. Additionally you can search for images by their name,
            size or type/file format. This makes it really easy to find exactly
            the images you need.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>What other tools are available?</h2>
          <p>
            In case some images are very bright, you can switch to a dark
            background to make them more visible. You can use the copy the URL
            of one or more images by clicking the link icon or the Copy selected
            URLs button. You can also very easily download indiviual images or
            multiple images at once by selecting them and then downloading them
            all in a ZIP archive.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>Is it free?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, extract.pics is free to use without creating an account! There
            is an hourly and daily limit on the number of extractions you can
            run to prevent abuse. However, you can extend these limits by
            creating an account or subscribing to a premium plan.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>How can I download images?</h2>
          <p>
            After the extraction process is finished you will find a list of all
            the images found on the website you entered. You can then use the
            button to download individual images.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>Can I download multiple images at once?</h2>
          <p>
            Of course, you can select them by clicking the images and the use
            the "Download selected" button on the left to download all selected
            images in a ZIP file. This can take some time depending on how many
            images you selected. Note that there is a chance that some images
            cannot be downloaded and won't be included in the ZIP file
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>The extraction does not work. Why?</h2>
          <p>
            There are several reasons why the extraction might fail. The website
            you entered might be not be publicly accessible or it might be
            protected by a login. Very slow or large websites might also cause
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            And sometimes there are a lot of people using extract.pics at the
            same time which can cause performance issues on our side. In this
            case you should try again later or try a different website. We are
            continuously working on improving the performance of our service.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>The download does not work. Why?</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes other websites block the download of images from their
            website. In this case you can right-click the images and press "Save
            image as..." or try to open the image in a new tab and download it
            from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            When trying to download multiple images at once, some images might
            not be included in the ZIP file, because they could not be
            downloaded. In this case you can try to download them individually.
            If the download does not work at all, please contact us.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            Everytime you start the extraction process the website you entered
            is openend in a Google Chrome browser. We then apply multiple
            different methods to find all the images (and even SVG elements) on
            the website. After that the images are analyzed to show useful
            information like type, name and size.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>Does it work with dynamic websites?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. Every website is viewed just like you view them in your
            browser. We use the latest version of the Google Chrome browser to
            process the websites you provide. After loading your website we
            execute JavaScript and wait for any requests to finish before
            starting the extraction process.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>How many images are extracted?</h2>
          <p>
            After the server navigates to the website you provided, it scrolls
            down really fast for a few seconds to find as many images as
            possible. Every image that the website loads in those first ~10
            seconds is then sent back to you. Tracking pixels and missing or
            invalid images are automatically removed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-area">
          <h2>What does "Image preview not available" mean?</h2>
          <p>
            This can have several reasons. The most common is that the
            webserver, the image is stored on, does not allow the image to be
            loaded/shown on other websites. If that is the case, we cannot
            display the image on the page. However, it is very likely that you
            are still able to download the image. If that fails too, try to open
            the image in a new tab.
